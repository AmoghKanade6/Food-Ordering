## ü§ñ AI Usage

This project incorporated **AI-assisted development** to enhance productivity and streamline implementation. The following details explain where and how AI was involved:

### üîß Model / Tool Used

- **ChatGPT** ‚Äî utilized to scaffold logic, generate reusable code structures, and assist with documentation.

### üß© AI-Generated Components

The following parts of the project were developed or assisted by AI:

- **`appwrite.js`** ‚Äì Appwrite integration (authentication, client setup, helper functions)
- **Zustand store code** ‚Äì Cart store, user store, and persistence helpers
- **UI components & layouts** ‚Äì Header, cart item, product card, search page, profile screens
- **Business logic & utilities** ‚Äì Price calculations, quantity updates, and memoized selectors
- **Documentation** ‚Äì README content, developer notes, and setup instructions

### ‚öôÔ∏è Handling AI-Generated Code

AI outputs served as **scaffolding and development accelerators**. Before using in production, ensure:

- All generated code is **reviewed**, **tested**, and **verified** for correctness and security.
- No sensitive data (API keys, credentials) is committed to the repository.
- Use **environment variables** or secure storage for secrets.

### üóÇÔ∏è Reproducibility & Transparency

To maintain transparency and reproducibility:

- Store AI prompts and generated snippets in a dedicated folder ‚Äî for example: `/docs/ai-prompts/`
- This helps reviewers and contributors understand what was requested and produced by AI.
